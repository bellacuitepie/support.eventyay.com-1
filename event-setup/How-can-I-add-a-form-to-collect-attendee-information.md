### e. Turn on attendee form

Eventyay has already created a standard form with basic information such as: `first name`, `last name` and `email`. You can always have an option of getting more information from attendees by choosing `turn on custom form`.

Select `turn on form`, you will have a full page of information for you to choose from, this is what a full form looks like. 
Most of the information needed have been set up, you only need to turn on as `include` and `require`.
